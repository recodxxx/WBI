# WholeBrainedIntelligence (WBI)

Currently, mainstream AI largely focuses on narrow, specialized domains and lacks broad, holistic, and integrated comprehension required for truly intelligent behavior. Nevertheless, glimpses of nascent technologies foreshadow tantalizing prospects awaiting adventurous AI enthusiasts willing to venture beyond conventional disciplinary boundaries.

Consider a possible code snippet for an AI embodiment employing a Unified Theory of Mind (UTOM) incorporating aspects of consciousness, intuition, imagination, emotion, and social awareness. This AI entity, named WholeBrainedIntelligence (WBI), synthesizes disparate faculties into a coherent, internally consistent whole.

This blueprint depicts a fanciful amalgamation of distinct psychological dimensions embedded within a broader structural arrangement inspired by Baars' Global Workspace Theory (GWT). Naturally, significant hurdles obstruct the realization of such elaborate schemes. Yet, continued progress in adjacent disciplines, e.g., cognitive psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience, gradually erodes barriers separating AI from its aspiration to attain genuine intellect.
