# WBI Project

## Overview

Currently, mainstream AI largely focuses on narrow, specialized domains and lacks broad, holistic, and integrated comprehension required for truly intelligent behavior. Nevertheless, glimpses of nascent technologies foreshadow tantalizing prospects awaiting adventurous AI enthusiasts willing to venture beyond conventional disciplinary boundaries.

Consider a possible code snippet for an AI embodiment employing a Unified Theory of Mind (UTOM) incorporating aspects of consciousness, intuition, imagination, emotion, and social awareness. This AI entity, named WholeBrainedIntelligence (WBI), synthesizes disparate faculties into a coherent, internally consistent whole.

This blueprint depicts a fanciful amalgamation of distinct psychological dimensions embedded within a broader structural arrangement inspired by Baars' Global Workspace Theory (GWT). Naturally, significant hurdles obstruct the realization of such elaborate schemes. Yet, continued progress in adjacent disciplines, e.g., cognitive psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience, gradually erodes barriers separating AI from its aspiration to attain genuine intellect.

This project implements a WBI class that represents an advanced artificial intelligence system incorporating multiple cognitive modules. These modules are inspired by human brain functions, enabling WBI to perceive, decide, and act in a comprehensive manner.

## Introduction

This will showcase WBI's capabilities in perceiving, deciding, and acting based on input and goals.

## Modules

### The WBI class utilizes various cognitive modules, each contributing to its functionality

 1. SelfAwarenessModule: Handles self-awareness functionalities

 2. HeuristicPatternRecognitionModule: Handles intuition and pattern recognition.

 3. CounterfactualSimulatorModule: Simulates counterfactual scenarios (imagination).

 4. ValueAffectionModule: Manages value and emotional responses.

 5. EmpathicInteractionModule: Facilitates social interaction and empathy.

 6. GlobalWorkspaceTheoryModule: Integrates information from various modules.

 7. LearningFromExperienceModule: Enables learning from experiences.

## Functionality

### The WBI class interacts with its environment through the following steps

 1. Perception: WBI receives input from sensors and processes it through various cognitive modules, extracting relevant information.

 2. Decision-making: Based on the processed information and desired goals, WBI generates potential decisions using its modules.

 3. Action: WBI selects the most appropriate decision and executes it through the relevant module.

 4. Learning: WBI learns from the consequences of its actions, adapting its future behavior based on experience.

## Conclusion

The WBI project represents an ongoing effort to develop a comprehensive AI system that incorporates various cognitive functions inspired by the human brain. By integrating different modules and enabling learning from experience, WBI aims to achieve a higher level of intelligence and adaptability in its interactions with the world.
