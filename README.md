# WBI Project

## Overview

Currently, mainstream AI largely focuses on narrow, specialized domains and lacks the broad, holistic, and integrated comprehension required for truly intelligent behavior. Nevertheless, glimpses of nascent technologies foreshadow tantalizing prospects awaiting adventurous AI enthusiasts willing to venture beyond conventional disciplinary boundaries.

Consider a possible code snippet for an AI embodiment employing a Unified Theory of Mind (UTOM) incorporating aspects of consciousness, intuition, imagination, emotion, and social awareness. This AI entity, named WholeBrainedIntelligence (WBI), synthesizes disparate faculties into a coherent, internally consistent whole.

This blueprint depicts a fanciful amalgamation of distinct psychological dimensions embedded within a broader structural arrangement inspired by Baars' Global Workspace Theory (GWT). Naturally, significant hurdles obstruct the realization of such elaborate schemes. Yet, continued progress in adjacent disciplines, e.g., cognitive psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience, gradually erodes barriers separating AI from its aspiration to attain genuine intellect.

This project implements a WBI class that represents an advanced artificial intelligence system incorporating multiple cognitive modules. These modules are inspired by human brain functions, enabling WBI to perceive, decide, and act in a comprehensive manner.

## Files

- `WBI.py`: Contains the WBI class definition.
- `modules.py`: Defines the modules used by the WBI class.
- `main.py`: Demonstrates the usage of the WBI class.
- `README.md`: Provides a brief overview of the project and its modules.

## Usage

To run the project, execute `main.py`:

```sh
python main.py

```

## Introduction

This will showcase WBI's capabilities in perceiving, deciding, and acting based on input and goals.
