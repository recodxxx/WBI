# WholeBrainedIntelligence (WBI) Code of Conduct

1. Purpose
The WholeBrainedIntelligence (WBI) project is committed to fostering an open and inclusive community where all individuals are treated with respect, dignity, and fairness. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for behavior and ensures that everyone can contribute to and benefit from the project in a positive and constructive manner.

2. Inclusivity and Diversity
We welcome and celebrate contributions from people of all backgrounds, identities, and experiences. Discrimination, harassment, or exclusion based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion, or any other characteristic will not be tolerated.

3. Respectful Communication
We value constructive and respectful communication among community members. When expressing opinions or providing feedback, please do so with empathy, kindness, and consideration for others' perspectives. Disagreements are inevitable, but personal attacks, insults, or inflammatory language have no place in our community.

4. Collaboration and Cooperation
The success of the WBI project relies on collaboration and cooperation among its members. We encourage active participation, sharing of ideas, and mutual support to achieve our common goals. Critique ideas, not individuals, and be open to learning from others' experiences and expertise.

All members of the WBI community are responsible for upholding this Code of Conduct. If you witness or experience behavior that violates these principles, please report it to the project maintainers promptly. We will take appropriate action to address any violations and ensure that our community remains safe and inclusive.

6. Enforcement
Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in temporary or permanent expulsion from the project community, as determined by the project maintainers. We will prioritize the safety and well-being of our members and take necessary measures to address any misconduct promptly.
